                                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                                        list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                                        from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                                        as this action is irreversible. Remember that using
                                        <span>Join</span> effectively requires
                                        consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
